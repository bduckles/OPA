## Open Post Academics 

This website is an introduction to OPA - the Open Post Academic Mentorship Program which is being incubated through the [Mozilla Open Leaders X program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/open-leaders-x/participants/).  

We are currently putting together materials for this program for launch in January 2020. 

### Purpose of OPA 
- To empower people with a PhD to share their knowledge and skills more openly. 

### Objectives of OPA 
- To expand the network of participants to more people outside of academia 
- For participants to understand their skill set and how to apply those abilities to projects outside of academia.
- To create a project that shares those skills openly.
