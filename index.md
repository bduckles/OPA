This website is an introduction to OPA - the Open Post Academic Mentorship Program which is being incubated through the [Mozilla Open Leaders X program](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/opportunity/mozilla-open-leaders/open-leaders-x/participants/).  

We are currently putting together materials for this program for launch in January 2020. 

### Purpose of OPA 
To empower people with a PhD to share their knowledge and skills more openly. 

### Objectives For OPA Participants 
- To expand the network of participants to more people outside of academia 
- For participants to understand their skill set and how to apply those abilities to projects outside of academia.
- To create a project that shares those skills openly. 

### Objectives for OPA Mentors and Experts 
- To offer folks who have PhDs and who work outside of academia a way to support those leaving the academy. 

### Join in! 
If you are interested in becoming a mentor, a part of the expert pool or a participant, please [fill out this short survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4bJko81Z9__AQ1aq7zMA5w3QQckwnXLHc_rLxluNlHhWsLA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and I'll be in touch with more information. 

In particular I am also looking for as many resources as I can find for how to do open scholarship and open science/humanities.
